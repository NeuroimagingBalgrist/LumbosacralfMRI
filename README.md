# LufMRI-pip
Pipeline for the analysis of lumbosacral fMRI

A comprehensive documentation of the pipeline can be found in the 00-Documentation folder. The pipeline is built in a way to easily allow for changes in each step. At this time-point nothing has been reviewed and validated. There might be serious flaws in the concept of the pipeline and/or and the implementation of the separate steps.
